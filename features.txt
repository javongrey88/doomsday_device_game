I’d suggest:

    Color Output:

        Use the colorama library to show destroyed states in red, spared states in green. Visually satisfying.

        Example: print(Fore.RED + "X" + Style.RESET_ALL)

    History Log:

        Keep a running list of decisions: "Florida - Destroyed", "Idaho - Spared" — print it at the end or save to file.

    Doomsday Progress Bar:

        Display how many states remain: “32 states remain intact...”

    State Facts (Educational Chaos):

        Pull a fun fact about the selected state before the user decides. "Did you know Kansas has more tornadoes than any other state?" — then BOOM — “DESTROY?”

    GUI Version:

        Build this out with tkinter or pygame for a map interface where clicking a state brings up the choice.

    Random Events:

        Sometimes, the Doomsday Device malfunctions and spares/destroys without asking. Adds chaos. Adds spice.

    Save & Resume Feature:

        Use pickle or json to save the state_grid and reload it later like a twisted apocalyptic save game.
